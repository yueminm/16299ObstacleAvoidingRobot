/*
This program tests the Elegoo Tumbller IR sensors.
The infrared light emitted by the light source is received by the
photosensitive element through the reï¬‚ection of the object to be
tested, so the interrupt will be triggered when reflected light
is detect. To distinguish this light from other light, we
turn this light on and off (presumably at a specific frequency (38kHz?),
and send only 39 flashes.
Presumably this is the only pattern the receiver responds to.
